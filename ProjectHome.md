**Naga is not a framework.**

Naga aims to be a very small NIO library that provides a handful of java classes to wrap the usual `Socket` and `ServerSocket` with asynchronous NIO counterparts (similar to NIO2 planned for Java 1.7).

All of this is driven from a _single_ thread, making it useful for both client (e.g. allowing I/O to be done in the AWT-thread without any need for threads) and server programming (1 thread for all connections instead of 2 threads/connection).

Internally Naga is a straightforward NIO implementation without any threads or event-queues thrown in, it is "just the NIO-stuff", to let you build things on top of it.

Naga contains the code needed to get NIO up and running _without_ having to code partially read buffers and setting various selection key flags.


Here is an example opening a server socket:

```
NIOService service = new NIOService;
NIOServerSocket serverSocket = service.openServerSocket(1234);
serverSocket.setConnectionAcceptor(myAcceptor);
serverSocket.listen(myObserver);
```

This is how working with a regular socket looks like:

```
NIOService service = new NIOService;
NIOSocket serverSocket = service.openSocket("www.google.com", 1234);
socket.listen(myObserver);
// Asynchronous write by default:
socket.write("Some message".getBytes());
```
